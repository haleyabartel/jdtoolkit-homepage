<p> Hello! Welcome to my website for Journalism + Design Toolkit.

<p> The link to this site's source code can be found
		<a href="https://github.com/haleyabartel/jdtoolkit-homepage"> here. </a>

<p> Here are some links to the work I've done for this class, including a
   <a href="logo.html">logo</a> I created for my Animal Crossing Island,

   a <a href="poster.html">poster</a> advertising the island,

   and some <a href="images.html">images</a> I edited.</p>

	The weekend Joe Biden won the election, I was lucky enough to get to go to Pennsylvania to cover the varied reactions there. Here is a video that I took at a "Stop the Steal" Trump rally held at the State Capitol in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.

	While the actual Trump rally was held at the other side of the building, this particular conflict took place near the front entrance on the steps.

  This map shows the makeup of the Capitol building in detail. The "Stop the Steal" rally was held on the side of the building facing Commonwealth Ave, and the stand-off shown in the video happened on the side facing N 3rd St.

  Here is the link to download a <a href="zine.html">zine</a> that I made about the weekend, if you're interested in seeing more.</p>
